# Learning TypeScript

The purpose of this app is to use it as a playground to learn TypeScript, following the book Learning TypeScript by Josh Goldberg.

## Motivation

After exploring job postings, I realized I was missing a crucial skill - TypeScript. I'm generally hesitant to learn dev concepts from YouTube or sites like Udemy because it would require heavy vetting of the person acting as the tutorial guide, therefore I have chosen to follow a textbook.

I trust textbooks as long as they're relatively up-to-date. The book I have purchased is the first edition from June 2022 (currently it is March 2023). Just a few days ago, TypeScript 5.0 was released so the textbook may be considered out of date but I plan to complete the textbook and review TypeScript 5.0 to see what has changed.

I aim to complete the textbook within 3 weeks. To solidify the concepts, I will be building real-life projects alongside this learning typescript app. The current projects ahead of me are the following: Vancity Darts Ltd. e-commerce site, Evolutz brand page, my portfolio, Machi Studio Inc. portfolio, Boba Monster brand page, and 3 projects that have not been officially confirmed as of the time that this document is written.

## Getting Started

This app was created using create-next-app: `npx create-next-app@latest`
To access, clone the repo and `npm install`, then `npm run dev` to start the development server (default to `localhost:3000`)
